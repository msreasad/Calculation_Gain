# Calculation_Gain
This repository contains the code used for calculating sound attenuation, target strength, and calibration gain for echosounder systems in fluid dynamics and acoustics experiments. It includes models for freshwater attenuation, received power calculations from echosounder data, and methods for calculating bubble target strength, which are relevant for research in marine acoustics.
